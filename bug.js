```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    This div should be red.
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    This div should be blue.
  </div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style two divs within a flex container.  However, if the `flex` container has unexpected behavior (e.g., unexpected width or height, items not aligning properly), it can affect the visibility of the background colors of the divs within.

The issue might not be immediately obvious as it relates to parent element behavior affecting the child elements.
