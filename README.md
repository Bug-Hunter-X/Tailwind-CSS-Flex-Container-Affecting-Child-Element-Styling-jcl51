# Tailwind CSS Flex Container Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where the styling of child elements within a flex container is unexpectedly affected by the parent container's behavior.  Specifically, the background colors of divs within the flex container may not be applied correctly if the parent flex container has unexpected dimensions or properties.

## Bug Description
The issue arises when using Tailwind CSS classes to style elements within a flex container.  If the flex container is not behaving as expected (e.g., incorrect width, height, or item alignment), the background colors of its child elements might not be rendered properly.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Observe that the background colors of the divs within the flex container may not be as expected.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully inspecting the parent flex container and addressing any issues that might be causing unexpected dimensions or properties.
