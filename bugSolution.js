```javascript
<div class="flex w-full">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2">
    This div should be red.
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2">
    This div should be blue.
  </div>
</div>
```
This solution adds the `w-full` class to the parent flex container, ensuring it occupies the full available width.  The `w-1/2` class is added to each child div, distributing the width evenly between them.  This direct width assignment prevents issues that might arise from unexpected dimensions of the parent.

Another potential solution might involve checking for conflicting Tailwind CSS classes or styles in parent elements that indirectly affect the flex container's dimensions or layout.  Addressing the root cause of the parent's unexpected behavior will resolve this issue.
